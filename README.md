# Project-2-Learning-Journal

Initially the tasks of project 2 were hard to understand but as a group we talked it through and recognised what was required of us. 

Overall it was easy, I think what was helpful for the brainstorming was that we followed brainstorming instructions and allowed ourselves to come up with really stupid ideas. I was surpised when we good ideas came from those stupid ones. Like we had 4 stupid ideas and took the best elements from each to create one good idea, we wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

I think this task tells me that I need to review a little of bit of earlier in the sem, as when the task said brainstorming steps 1 to 8 I had no idea what it was talking about. It took a bit of flicking through the old modules to understand what those 8 steps were.

Once we got together as a group and understood what we had to do the task didn't take long to complete
