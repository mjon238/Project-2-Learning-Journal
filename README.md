# Project-2,3,4-Learning-Journal

Project 2:
Initially the tasks of project 2 were hard to understand but as a group we talked it through and recognised what was required of us. 

Overall it was easy, I think what was helpful for the brainstorming was that we followed brainstorming instructions and allowed ourselves to come up with really stupid ideas. I was surpised when we good ideas came from those stupid ones. Like we had 4 stupid ideas and took the best elements from each to create one good idea, we wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

I think this task tells me that I need to review a little of bit of earlier in the sem, as when the task said brainstorming steps 1 to 8 I had no idea what it was talking about. It took a bit of flicking through the old modules to understand what those 8 steps were.

Once we got together as a group and understood what we had to do the task didn't take long to complete

Project 4:
Project 4 Reflection

The completion of this project has been incredibly satisfying. We all worked really hard throughout each stage of app creation, and ulimately we created an effective but also easy to use application. Furthermore I feel we did well in both the oral and written communication part, we all contributed evenly and effectively. As a result our presentation was good and our written submission was good. Throughout completing this project I have felt I could rely on my teammates and we all contributed fairly.

Now I need to shift focus to the final test which is in 6 days.
